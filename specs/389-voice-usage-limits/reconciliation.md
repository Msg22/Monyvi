# Planning reconciliation and approval package

Reviewed locally on 2026-10-07. No implementation or worker assignments. The
original T001–T059 checklist is preserved and refined in place.

## Source and authorization

- Worktree: `E:/Work/My Projects/Monyvi-issue347-voice-usage-limits`.
- Published handoff: `dcf1671daa4b2ab14bc2b8846911d411e6c08a0d`.
- Governing main: `2095ec061d531854603e8415122231f1cbf4c1a0`.
- Main merged and published to `389-voice-usage-limits` at
  `d97146960593117e61797e65bca852cec6bc7fbf`.
- Current owner request authorizes local planning reconciliation without
  delegation before implementation, overriding the generic lead-only-edit
  restriction for these planning artifacts. No product code or tests authored.
- Source chat `Branch · Branch · Compare AI Providers Value`,
  `6ac61c86-60d8-83ea-b794-143b4aea9d5d`, confirms the preserved 59-task draft,
  pending bindings/contracts, stopped cloud work, and execution-pool order.
- Branch sync was separately requested. Further planning commits/pushes and
  implementation are not implied by the sync operation.

## Replay retention choice — APPROVED

Owner selected on 2026-10-07 in chat 01a11606-3a5e-7420-a9d7-0ea491bde802:
"let's delete the id after 35 days, that's fine."

The selected policy protects same-key replay for 35 elapsed days (35 × 24 hours)
from immutable first server record `created_at`. Retries/status updates do not
extend that cutoff. At/after it, bounded cleanup deletes eligible whole terminal
work-request records, including identity. No account-lifetime tombstone,
details- only compaction or third table is introduced.

Cleanup serializes with admission/start under the same per-user lock, rechecks
eligibility and preserves all active work/leases/current daily/burst/reservation
accounting. It never deletes active usage windows or refunds current consumed
units. A retained expired record still protects replay until actual deletion.
After eligible deletion, the same key may be admitted as new only under current
auth/consent/validation/entitlement/quota gates.

Spec FR-010/FR-013/SC-004, plan, data model, R-004/R-012, parse request
contract, quickstart, existing task tests and business decisions now carry this
rule. SQL cutoff/concurrency/cleanup and HTTP readmission tests are planned, not
executed. Lifetime identity retention was considered and not selected.

## Binding reconstruction — APPROVED

Original images remain unchanged. Original viewport/font/token facts cannot be
recovered as authoritative from a framed raster. The owner approved the two
sidecars' normalized implementation context on 2026-10-07:

- 390 x 844 logical dp baseline, Arabic/light/font scale 1; fixture safe-area
  insets 24 top/34 bottom; runtime uses actual insets once.
- Existing standalone stack/back route. The pictured bottom tab bar is
  illustrative; no new Add tab or global-navigation redesign.
- Preserve card hierarchy, green microphone/halo, allowance progress, examples,
  mode tabs and compact Manual allowance strip.
- Exact spacing, sizing, palette/font tokens, interaction/state mapping,
  responsive/dark/RTL/enlarged-text adaptations are in the two sidecars.
- Existing Manual form semantics win over illustrative merchant/type fields.
  Required markers and bottom-safe-area treatment follow current shared rules.
- Local-midnight reset wording replaces the superseded raster wording.

Owner reply: "Approve both proposed bindings and copy" in chat
01a11606-3a5e-7420-a9d7-0ea491bde802, call_3SOfr0FPm3RmUNgWIRuA5lS8 item 0.
Exact approved combined revisions:

Both verifiers exited zero after recording approval. Image and Binding Facts
bytes are unchanged; proposal wording inside the frozen facts is now adopted by
this approval. The normalized context is not original historical evidence. Any
change to binding facts requires recomputed revisions and renewed approval.
Rendered visual and accessibility evidence remain separate subsequent gates.

Current recording timer, permission/consent dialogs, review copy and Manual
field labels remain their current localized contracts. The copy above adds no
merchant promise, paid-plan name, timezone jargon or rolling-24-hour reset.

## Runtime evidence boundary

Planning checks validate artifacts only. No behavioral Red/Green, emulator
journey, screenshot fidelity, accessibility, real provider or hosted deployment
completion is claimed. T004/T005 remain prerequisites for implementation; voice
provider-double/audio/server-clock controls require explicit verified harness
evidence. Existing SMS fixture mode does not prove Voice E2E capability.

Optional before/after `speckit.analyze` commit hooks are not executed. Git Bash
at `C:/Program Files/Git/bin/bash.exe` is the validated prerequisite runner; the
generic Windows `bash` resolves WSL and selected the wrong feature despite the
supplied environment. Use Git Bash with both explicit feature overrides.

Execution pool capability checks and actual role/owner mapping wait until the
implementation phase. Order: user-created Normal ChatGPT chats, suitable
OpenCode, Antigravity, then justified native fallback for the specific task.

## Execution-interface reconciliation — 7 October 2026

Runtime intake found no current Voice RPC/contract/provider seam. Existing
parse-voice can be exercised through test-only Deno SDK import maps with
synthetic auth/consent/provider data, so initial quota/replay/input behavioral
Red can precede minimal local interface implementation. Direct contract and
actual multi-session SQL Red then precede their further behavior. Undefined
modules/functions remain setup blockers and HTTP evidence does not count as DB
race evidence. tasks.md and plan.md now state this staged sequence without
regenerating tasks or changing product/API/retention/binding decisions. The
import-map runner remains source-inferred until executed by local QA; production
release awaits refreshed analyze and accepted runtime evidence.

Independent local QA caught stale final plan sequencing and premature direct
T007 foundation language; both are corrected. Genuine race evidence additionally
requires passing single-request controls first: all-deny callable stubs do not
prove final-slot contention. Already-Green races are retained as regression
evidence; no artificial defect is introduced to manufacture Red.

## Bounded cleanup parameter freeze

Lead accepted server's technical recommendation: hourly minute17, maximum500
eligible work-request rows per invocation. This is bounded scheduling capacity,
not a new retention or commercial rule. SQL tests must prove the job/batch
configuration, per-user lock recheck, repeated backlog drainage and preservation
of all active/current accounting. Protection lasts while identity is retained;
reuse as new begins only after actual deletion.
